Advanced Weather Website
The Advanced Weather Website is a web application that allows users to search for weather details of different locations using either a name or a pin code. It provides a modern and attractive interface with two halves - the first half displaying today's weather details, and the second half showing a weekly weather report of the searched location. The background dynamically changes based on the current weather condition. Users can also toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius units for temperature display.
